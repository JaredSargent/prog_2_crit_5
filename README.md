# Week 5 Critical Thinking Assignment - Option #1: Recursive Product - Jared

## Project Description
This program calculates the product of five user-entered numbers using recursion. It demonstrates recursive programming by breaking the multiplication into smaller subproblems. The program includes a base case (one number left) and a recursive case (multiply current number by product of rest).

## File Contents
- `RecursiveProduct.java`: Main Java source code containing the recursive product logic

## How to Run
1. Ensure Java is installed (JDK version 8 or higher recommended).
2. Compile the program:  
   `javac RecursiveProduct.java`
3. Execute the program:  
   `java RecursiveProduct`
4. Follow prompts to enter five numbers (integers or decimals).
5. View the output displaying the product of the numbers.

## Example Usage
**Input:**  
Enter five numbers: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
**Output:**  
The product of the five numbers is: 720.0

## Version Control
This project uses Git for version control. Initial commit includes the `RecursiveProduct.java` file. See screenshot of Git repository for commit history.
